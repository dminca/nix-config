#Short summary of changes introduced by this patch
#
#Most importantly, describe what is changed with the commit
#and not what is has not been working
#(that is part of the bug report already).
#
#More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to 74 characters.
#The first line is treated as the subject of the commit message and 
#the rest of the text as the body.  The blank line separating the 
#subject from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); 
#tools like git rebase can get confused if you run the two together.
#
#Write your commit message in the '''imperative present tense'''
#("Fix bug", not "Fixed bug"). This convention matches up with generated 
#commit messages by commands like git merge and git revert.
#
#Help others to understand what you did (Motivation for the change?
#Whats the difference to the previous version?), but keep it simple.
#
#Problem description as well as testing and/or reproduction instructions
#shall be part of the Forge ticket referenced below.
#The commit message solely describes '''what is changed'''.
#
#* Bullet points are okay, too
#* An asterisk is used for the bullet, it can be preceded by a single
#  space. This format is rendered correctly by Forge (redmine)
#* Use a hanging indent
